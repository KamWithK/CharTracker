# exSTATic - Zero effort language learning IMMERSION statistic collection and visualisation!

exSTATic aims to make it easy for language learners to immerse in their target language without sacrificing high quality progress tracking.
exSTATic is a new project currently in its early stages and so is currently focused on smoothening out the Visual Novel (VN) reading experience.

The core web extension lies in this repository, whilst additional addons allow integration with various platoforms:

* [TextractorSender](https://github.com/KamWithK/TextractorSender) - hooks VN lines and send them directly to exSTATic (or potentially other applications which wish to use the WebSocket connection, this doesn't impede/use a clipboard)


*Going forwards in the future, to account for other immersion mediums, integrations with other platforms like TTU, YouTube and maybe even Anki will be considered*

# Instructions

Setup is split into two parts:

1) Downloading & importing the browser extension - from this repository
2) Downloading & importing the integrations - from the repositories linked above

Once you download the files simply add them to your addons.
Start each one up and then navigate to the [main page](https://kamwithk.github.io/exSTATic/char-tracker.html).
Your stats should from then on be recorded!

**WARNING:** If the main page isn't open your stats might not be recorded correctly, this has not yet been tested

**NOTE:** You may be warned on Chromium browsers that this extension uses the outdated Manifest V2 format, ignore this, Manifest V2 is officially still supported on both Firefox and Brave and so for the foreseeable future there are no plans to upgrade to V3 (due to technical complications)

## Credits
Huge shoutout to everyone who helped on this project.
Thanks to Mae for helping design the UI (making sure it looks lit), helping with testing and giving lots of ideas for potentially useful features.

Cheers to Mae, Marv and Alex from The Moe Way for providing me with sample data to use for testing and showcasing stats for this project!
