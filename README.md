# CharTracker
Zero effort reading with baked in statistics!

Currently only for Visual Novels (VNs) via Textractor ([via related extension](https://github.com/KamWithK/TextractorSender)) but might support other books further on

# Credits
Huge shoutout to everyone who helped support this project.
Thanks to Mae for helping design the UI (making sure it looks lit), helping with testing and giving lots of ideas for potentially useful features.

Cheers to Mae, Marv and Alex from The Moe Way for providing me with sample data to use for testing and showcasing stats for this project!
