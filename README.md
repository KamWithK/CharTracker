# exSTATic - Zero effort language learning IMMERSION statistic collection and visualisation!

exSTATic aims to make it easy for language learners to immerse in their target language without sacrificing high quality progress tracking.
exSTATic is a new project currently in its early stages and so is currently focused on smoothening out the Visual Novel (VN) reading experience.

The core web extension lies in this repository, whilst additional addons allow integration with various platoforms:

* [TextractorSender](https://github.com/KamWithK/TextractorSender) - hooks VN lines and send them directly to exSTATic (or potentially other applications which wish to use the WebSocket connection, this doesn't impede/use a clipboard)


*Going forwards in the future, to account for other immersion mediums, integrations with other platforms like TTU, YouTube and maybe even Anki will be considered*

## Contributions

## Credits
Huge shoutout to everyone who helped on this project.
Thanks to Mae for helping design the UI (making sure it looks lit), helping with testing and giving lots of ideas for potentially useful features.

Cheers to Mae, Marv and Alex from The Moe Way for providing me with sample data to use for testing and showcasing stats for this project!
